          Affidavit Of Defendant No.1 In Support Of I.A. For Amendment Of Written Statement Affidavit Under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC
        </h3>

        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          I, Mrs. Kavitha Rao, W/o Suresh Rao, aged about 53 years, residing at Pristine estates, Defendant No.1 in the above suit, do hereby solemnly affirm and state as follows:
        </p>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">1.</span> It is submitted that the present suit, O.S. No. 214 of 2024, has been filed by the plaintiff Mr. Arjun Reddy against the Defendants for specific performance on the basis of an Agreement of Sale dated 18.06.2023 in respect of certain immovable property, alleging full readiness and willingness on his part and seeking a decree for execution of sale deed over the entire schedule property.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">2.</span> It is submitted that the defendants herein filed their original Written Statement on 20.06.2024, wherein the signatures on the suit agreement were admitted but it was specifically pleaded that the alleged agreement was only executed as security for a loan transaction and not intended as a contract for sale. The defendant further denied the plaintiff&apos;s readiness and willingness, the alleged cash payment, and disputed the adequacy and genuineness of the stated consideration.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">3.</span> It is submitted that subsequent to the filing of the Written Statement, during the course of proceedings and particularly during the cross-examination of the plaintiff and perusal of record, certified copies of the relevant title and revenue documents were obtained in December 2025. These documents, which were not available in the possession of the defendants earlier due to a long-standing family dispute and lack of access to the original deeds and records, revealed significant facts having direct bearing on the real controversy in this suit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">4.</span> It is most respectfully submitted that the following crucial facts have now come to the attention of the defendants:
          </p>

          <div className="pl-6 space-y-2">
            <p>(i) That as per the certified records, the defendants were in joint ownership of only Ac. 0.32 guntas of the property in question as on the date of the alleged agreement, and were not owners or possessors of the larger extent described in the suit schedule.</p>
            
            <p>(ii) That a substantial part of the purported suit property, namely Ac. 0.78 guntas, had already been validly sold and conveyed under Document No. 4876/2019 dated 21.08.2019 to M/s GreenNest Projects LLP, thereby rendering the defendants no longer the owners of the said extent as of 18.06.2023.</p>
            
            <p>(iii) That the larger suit schedule property as described in the plaint is both vague and over-inclusive and cannot be specifically identified with reference to existing boundaries or survey records, and further, substantial parts are subject to adverse revenue remarks or are notified as prohibited/protected property under revenue records.</p>
            
            <p>(iv) That the plaintiff was well aware of the said facts of the prior conveyance, joint ownership, and status of revenue/prohibited properties before institution of the suit but willfully suppressed the same and sought relief on incomplete and incorrect schedules.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">5.</span> It is respectfully submitted that the above facts are material for the fair and just adjudication of the real controversy in the suit, being directly relevant to the issue of title, enforceability of the specific performance, and the extent, if any, to which relief, if otherwise grantable, may be considered.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">6.</span> It is submitted that the following specific amendments are now sought to be made to the Written Statement, immediately after the existing Paragraph 7:
          </p>

          <div className="pl-6 space-y-3 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/30 p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-blue-500">
            <p className="font-semibold">Para 7(a):</p>
            <p>The suit schedule property as described in the plaint is incorrect and misleading. The defendants herein were, as on the date of the alleged Agreement of Sale (18.06.2023), jointly entitled to and in possession of only Ac. 0.32 guntas.</p>
            
            <p className="font-semibold pt-2">Para 7(b):</p>
            <p>That out of the total schedule land, Ac. 0.78 guntas was sold and conveyed under Doc. No. 4876/2019 dated 21.08.2019 to M/s GreenNest Projects LLP, and the defendants had neither right, title nor interest over said extent as on 18.06.2023.</p>
            
            <p className="font-semibold pt-2">Para 7(c):</p>
            <p>The schedule of property in the plaint is vague, composite, and not clearly identifiable with reference to existing revenue or survey records, and includes extents not owned by the defendants and/or lands subject to adverse revenue remarks and prohibitions.</p>
            
            <p className="font-semibold pt-2">Para 7(d):</p>
            <p>The plaintiff had full knowledge of the above facts regarding prior sale and revenue/prohibited status, but has willfully suppressed the same for extraneous gain and is not entitled to the equitable relief of specific performance.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">7.</span> It is further submitted that a consequential amendment is necessary in the prayer/relief clause of the Written Statement to the effect that, in view of the above facts, the suit for specific performance is absolutely misconceived and liable to be dismissed for want of enforceability and lack of title.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">8.</span> It is most respectfully submitted that the amendments proposed herein do not alter the fundamental nature of the defence as originally taken, and are necessary only to bring on record the real state of affairs as revealed upon subsequent access to genuine public records. No prejudice will be caused to the plaintiff by allowing the amendment.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">9.</span> It is submitted that the present application is bonafide, indispensable for just adjudication, does not cause injustice or surprise to the other side, and is moved without undue delay after discovery and receipt of certified documents. The same is permissible under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC read with Section 151 CPC.
          </p>

        <div className="pt-6 space-y-3 border-t border-neutral-300 dark:border-neutral-700">
          <h4 className="font-bold text-center">PRAYER</h4>
          <p>It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon&apos;ble Court may be pleased to:</p>
          <p className="pl-6">a) Permit the defendants to amend their Written Statement as stated in paragraph 6 above by inserting Paras 7(a), 7(b), 7(c), and 7(d) immediately after existing Paragraph 7 along with necessary consequential amendments in the relief/prayer clause, in the interests of justice;</p>
          <p className="pl-6">b) Grant such other and further reliefs as this Hon&apos;ble Court deems fit and proper in the interests of equity and justice.</p>
